# Sand üèù
Sand is a Dockerfile generator.

It allows you to write cleaner, shorter and more configurable Dockerfiles.

## Developers ‚ù§Ô∏è Sand
Sand is built by developers, for developers. It's built to be as simple as possible, while still being super useful.

## Features
‚úÖ Simple, easy to learn syntax based on Python.

‚úÖ Configurable Dockerfiles. 

‚úÖ Share code between Dockerfiles.

‚úÖ Perfect for monorepos composed of multiple microservices.

# Example
Write your Dockerfile in a Python-like syntax.
```python
# Sandfile
from sand import *

From("ubuntu", Tag="20.04")
Run("apt-get update")
Run("apt-get install ffmpeg python3")

# Install python debugger on debug images.
if config.DEBUG:
    Run("pip3 install pdb")

Copy("app", "/app")
Entrypoint("python3 /app/app.py")
```
‚¨áÔ∏è
```dockerfile
# Auto-generated by Sand, do not edit!
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install ffmpeg python3
COPY app /app
ENTRYPOINT python3 /app/app.py
```

### Share Code
Because `Sandfile`s are just Python files, and are being evaluated in an hierarchical manner by using the `Sand` directive, so you can easily share code between them.

Given the following directory structure:
```
my-monorepo/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tweet-service/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sandfile
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home-timeline/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sandfile
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sandfile
```
You can write your `Sandfile`s like this:
```python
# ./my-monorepo/Sandfile
from sand import *

def MyService(name):
    From("ubuntu", "20.04")
    Run(f"apt-get install python3")
    Copy(Src="app", Dst="/app")
    Entrypoint(f"python3 /app/{name}.py")

Sand("tweet-service")
Sand("home-timeline")
```
```python
# ./my-monorepo/tweet-service/Sandfile
from sand import *

MyService("tweet-service") # Defined in ../Sandfile
```

```python
# ./my-monorepo/home-timeline/Sandfile
from sand import *

MyService("home-timeline") # Defined in ../Sandfile
```

This allows you to share code between your Dockerfiles, and keep them [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).


## Usage
Running Sand is as simple as running `sand` in your terminal.
This will generate Dockerfiles for all Sandfiles in the current directory.
```
$ sand config
Saving Dockerfile to backend/service1/Dockerfile
Saving Dockerfile to backend/service2/Dockerfile
Built successfully!
```
You can also watch for changes and automatically rebuild your Dockerfiles.
```
$ sand config -w
Watching for changes...
```

### Configuration
You can pass configuration values to Sand using the `-D` or `--set` flag.
```
$ sand config -DDEBUG=True
```
Or use a YAML file. (not implemented yet)
```yaml
# sand.yaml
DEBUG: True
```
```
$ sand config --values sand.yaml
```
